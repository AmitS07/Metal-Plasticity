This repository contais the basic Python code and function to do the following analysis in stress strain data from raw data of laod vs displacment, 
(i)- The Eng. stress-strain calculation, preload correction and plot
(ii)- The Ramberg-Osgood(RO) correction of the Eng. Stress-strain data and plot
(iii)- Yield offset correction and yield strength estimation and plot
(iv)- True stress-strain calculation and plot
